# Systematic Review Screener

Automated abstract screening tool for systematic literature reviews with PRISMA workflow support.

## Quick Check

Use this command to verify that the packaged script entry point can be parsed before deeper execution.

```bash
python -m py_compile scripts/main.py
```

## Audit-Ready Commands

Use these concrete commands for validation. They are intentionally self-contained and avoid placeholder paths.

```bash
python -m py_compile scripts/main.py
python scripts/main.py --help
python scripts/main.py -h
python scripts/main.py --help
```

## When to Use

- Use this skill when the task needs Automated abstract screening tool for systematic literature reviews with PRISMA workflow support.
- Use this skill for evidence insight tasks that require explicit assumptions, bounded scope, and a reproducible output format.
- Use this skill when you need a documented fallback path for missing inputs, execution errors, or partial evidence.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the user objective, required inputs, and non-negotiable constraints before doing detailed work.
2. Validate that the request matches the documented scope and stop early if the task would require unsupported assumptions.
3. Use the packaged script path or the documented reasoning path with only the inputs that are actually available.
4. Return a structured result that separates assumptions, deliverables, risks, and unresolved items.
5. If execution fails or inputs are incomplete, switch to the fallback path and state exactly what blocked full completion.

## Overview

This skill screens academic abstracts against predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria, generating PRISMA-compliant outputs with decision rationale and confidence scores.

**Technical Difficulty: High** ⚠️ Manual verification recommended for final inclusion decisions.

## Features

- **Multi-format Input**: PubMed MEDLINE, EndNote XML, CSV/TSV
- **Criteria Matching**: Configurable inclusion/exclusion rules
- **Confidence Scoring**: 0-100% confidence for each decision
- **Conflict Detection**: Flags abstracts requiring human review
- **PRISMA Export**: Flow diagram data and screening log
- **Batch Processing**: Handles large reference sets efficiently

## Usage

### Basic Screening

```python
# Run with default settings
python scripts/main.py --input references.csv --criteria criteria.yaml
```

### With PRISMA Export

```python
python scripts/main.py --input references.xml --criteria criteria.yaml \
  --output results/ --prisma --format excel
```

### Confidence Threshold

```python
python scripts/main.py --input refs.txt --criteria criteria.yaml \
  --threshold 0.8 --conflict-only
```

## Input Formats

### 1. CSV/TSV
Required columns: `title`, `abstract` (optional: `authors`, `year`, `doi`, `pmid`)

```csv
title,abstract,authors,year
title,abstract,authors,year
```

### 2. PubMed MEDLINE
Standard .txt export from PubMed search.

### 3. EndNote XML
Export from EndNote with abstracts included.

## Criteria File (YAML)

See `references/criteria_template.yaml` for complete example:

```yaml
study_type:
  include:
    - "randomized controlled trial"
    - "systematic review"
  exclude:

| `screened_included.csv` | Records passing all criteria |
| `screened_excluded.csv` | Records failing one or more criteria |
| `conflicts.csv` | Low-confidence decisions requiring review |
| `prisma_data.json` | PRISMA flow diagram counts |
| `screening_log.json` | Full decision trail with rationale |

## PRISMA Workflow Support

Generates structured data for PRISMA 2020 flow diagram:

```json
{
  "identification": {
    "database_results": 1250,
    "register_results": 45,
    "other_sources": 12
  },
  "screening": {
    "records_screened": 1307,
    "records_excluded": 1150,
    "full_text_assessed": 157,
    "full_text_excluded": 89
  },
  "included": {
    "qualitative_synthesis": 68,
    "quantitative_synthesis": 42
  }
}
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```text
export SCREENING_THRESHOLD=0.75  # Default confidence threshold
export BATCH_SIZE=100             # Records per batch
export MAX_WORKERS=4              # Parallel processing workers
```

### Command Line Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--input` | Input file path | Required |
| `--criteria` | Criteria YAML path | Required |
| `--output` | Output directory | `./output` |
| `--format` | Output format: csv/excel/json | csv |
| `--threshold` | Confidence threshold | 0.75 |
| `--prisma` | Generate PRISMA data | False |
| `--conflict-only` | Export only conflicts | False |
| `--batch-size` | Processing batch size | 100 |

## Decision Algorithm

1. **Keyword Matching**: Exact and fuzzy keyword matching against title/abstract
2. **Inclusion Scoring**: Points for each inclusion criterion matched
3. **Exclusion Check**: Immediate exclusion if exclusion criterion detected
4. **Confidence Calculation**: Weighted score based on keyword presence and clarity
5. **Conflict Flagging**: Records with confidence < threshold flagged for manual review

## Limitations

- **Not for Final Decisions**: Tool provides recommendations; human review required for inclusion
- **Language Dependent**: Optimized for English abstracts
- **Structured Abstracts**: Performs better on structured abstracts (Background/Methods/Results/Conclusion)
- **Domain Specific**: Criteria must be tailored to research question

## Output Requirements

Every final response should make these items explicit when they are relevant:

- Objective or requested deliverable
- Inputs used and assumptions introduced
- Workflow or decision path
- Core result, recommendation, or artifact
- Constraints, risks, caveats, or validation needs
- Unresolved items and next-step checks

## Error Handling

- If required inputs are missing, state exactly which fields are missing and request only the minimum additional information.
- If the task goes outside the documented scope, stop instead of guessing or silently widening the assignment.
- If `scripts/main.py` fails, report the failure point, summarize what still can be completed safely, and provide a manual fallback.
- Do not fabricate files, citations, data, search results, or execution outcomes.

## Input Validation

This skill accepts requests that match the documented purpose of `systematic-review-screener` and include enough context to complete the workflow safely.

Do not continue the workflow when the request is out of scope, missing a critical input, or would require unsupported assumptions. Instead respond:

> `systematic-review-screener` only handles its documented workflow. Please provide the missing required inputs or switch to a more suitable skill.

## Response Template

Use the following fixed structure for non-trivial requests:

1. Objective
2. Inputs Received
3. Assumptions
4. Workflow
5. Deliverable
6. Risks and Limits
7. Next Checks

If the request is simple, you may compress the structure, but still keep assumptions and limits explicit when they affect correctness.

## When Not to Use

- Do not proceed when required input files, identifiers, parameters, or context are missing — ask the user to provide them first.
- Do not assume capabilities beyond this skill's declared scope when the user requests external operations or inferences.
- Do not proceed without user confirmation when overwriting existing results, executing high-cost batch operations, or expanding task scope.

## Required Inputs

| Field | Required | Format/Source | Example | If Missing |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| User task description | Yes | Text | Research question, writing goal, analysis objective | Stop and ask user to provide |
| Primary input material | Depends on task | Text, file path, ID, table, or literature | PMID, PDF, CSV, DOCX, keywords, etc. | Specify which material type is missing |
| Output preference | No | Text | Language, format, target journal, template | Use skill default format |

## Output Contract

- Primary output: Structured result or target file aligned with this skill's objective.
- Optional output: Intermediate check notes, issue list, supplementary suggestions, or generated file paths.
- Format requirement: Unless the user specifies otherwise, prefer stable, reviewable Markdown or JSON; if the skill's bundled script requires a fixed format, use that format.
- If partially complete: Must explicitly mark as PARTIAL and state which steps are completed and which remain.

## Failure Handling

- Missing critical input: Explicitly state which fields, files, or identifiers are missing and pause.
- Script, template, or resource execution failure: Report the failing step, likely cause, and recovery suggestions — do not silently degrade.
- Partial completion only: Return the verified portion first, then list remaining blockers and suggested next steps.

## User Checkpoints

- Before executing batch processing, overwriting files, long-running searches, or multi-stage generation, confirm scope and output format with the user.
- Before proceeding when a key judgment is ambiguous, evidence is insufficient, or the workflow is entering the next stage, confirm with the user.

## Quick Validation

- Check that key scripts, templates, or reference file paths this skill depends on exist.
- Check that the final output contains the core fields, sections, or files specified for this task.
- Check that results clearly mark assumptions, limitations, and incomplete items.
